# leaflet-challenge
## Background:
The United States of Geological Survey (USGS) provides sceintific data regarding ecosystems, the climate, land-use change, and natural hazards. Ths assignment allowed me to leverage the JSON data provided by the USGS to plot earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depth in conjunction with the tectonic plate borders. We can see that often the location of the earthquakes conincide with the boundaries of the tectonic plates.

## Objective:
Create a useful visualization via JS and Leaflet to provide information regarding earthquakes. This includes building a map wit multiple layers (base and overlay), markers, and popups to provide more information about the specific earthquake event. Using the lat and longitude, we marked the earthquake on the map, dictated the size of the marker based on the earthquake's magnitude, and gave the color more depth if it was deeper under the surface.

This was all done using Leaflet, JS, CSS, and HTML.
